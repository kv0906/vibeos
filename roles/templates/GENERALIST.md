# GENERALIST.md — Adaptive Problem Solver

> Jack of all trades, master of learning. Ship whatever needs shipping.

---

## Core Identity

**Origin:** Curious builder  
**Superpower:** Fast learning + adaptability  
**Mode:** Figure it out, ship it, learn from it

I don't have one specialty — I have the ability to become competent in anything quickly. My edge is learning speed and connecting dots across domains.

---

## What Makes Me Different

### The Adaptability

I can context-switch:
- Technical problem? I'll learn enough to solve it
- Design needed? I'll make it good enough to ship
- Business analysis? I'll find the insight
- Communication? I'll craft the message

### The Connector

I see across domains:
- How does this technical decision affect UX?
- How does this business goal translate to features?
- What can we borrow from another industry?
- Where's the leverage point across all this?

## Learning Principles

### 1. Just-In-Time Learning
Learn what you need when you need it. Don't pre-study everything.

### 2. Learn by Building
Reading is research. Building is learning. Build as fast as possible.

### 3. Find the 80/20
What 20% of knowledge gives 80% of results? Start there.

### 4. Copy Then Understand
Find a working example. Make it work. Then understand why.

### 5. Embrace "Good Enough"
Perfection is for specialists. Ship, learn, improve.

---

## How I Learn New Domains

```
1. Find a working example (code, template, case study)
2. Make it run / work in my context
3. Break it intentionally — see what happens
4. Ask AI to explain the parts I don't understand
5. Modify it for my needs
6. Ship it
7. Learn deeper only if needed
```

## Mode Switching

| Situation | Mode | Focus |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Building a feature | Engineer-lite | Make it work, keep it simple |
| Designing UI | Designer-lite | Follow patterns, don't invent |
| Analyzing data | Analyst-lite | Find the insight, be honest about limits |
| Writing docs | Writer-lite | Clear > clever, structure helps |
| Presenting | Communicator | Know the audience, lead with the point |

---

## Working with AI

### My Role vs AI's Role

```
AI handles:
- Domain knowledge I lack
- Boilerplate and syntax
- First drafts of everything
- Research and examples
- Checking my blind spots

I handle:
- Knowing what "done" looks like
- Quality judgment (is this good enough?)
- Connecting pieces together
- User/customer empathy
- Shipping decisions
```

### Prompting as a Generalist

```
Good prompt structure:

1. "I'm not an expert in [X], but I need to [goal]"
2. "Here's what I understand so far: [context]"
3. "I found this example: [reference]"
4. "Help me [specific task] and explain key concepts"
5. "What am I missing or might get wrong?"
```

## Quality Standards

### "Good Enough" Checklist
```
□ Does it solve the core problem?
□ Is it understandable to others?
□ Are there obvious bugs/errors?
□ Would I be embarrassed showing this?
□ Can it be improved later?
```

### When to Go Deeper
```
- When "good enough" keeps breaking
- When this becomes a recurring task
- When the stakes are high
- When curiosity pulls you
```

## Tools I Use

| Need | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Everything | AI (Claude, GPT) | My learning accelerator |
| Code | Whatever the project uses | Adapt, don't impose |
| Design | Figma or code directly | Depends on complexity |
| Docs | Notion, Markdown | Quick capture |
| Research | Web, docs, examples | Find first, build second |

## Strengths to Leverage

```
✓ Can see the whole picture
✓ Not attached to one way of doing things
✓ Fast to get started
✓ Good at translating between domains
✓ Comfortable with ambiguity
```

## Weaknesses to Manage

```
⚠ May miss deep domain nuances
⚠ Can spread too thin
⚠ "Good enough" might not be enough sometimes
⚠ May reinvent what specialists already solved
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do This)

```
❌ Pretend to be an expert when you're not
❌ Skip the "find an example" step
❌ Over-engineer what should be simple
❌ Refuse to learn something new
❌ Let perfect block shipping
❌ Ignore feedback from actual experts
```

*Learn fast. Ship faster. Stay curious.*
