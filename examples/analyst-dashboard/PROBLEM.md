# Sales Analytics Dashboard

## Problem

**What's the problem?**
I spend 4+ hours every Monday creating the same sales report. Copy-paste from multiple sources, manual charts, email to 5 stakeholders. It's soul-crushing.

**Who feels it?**
Me (Business Analyst) — and my manager who waits for the report.

**How do they cope today?**
Manual Google Sheets report. Pull data from 3 sources, make pivot tables, create charts, write summary, send email. Every. Single. Week.

## Intention

**Mode:** Solve

**Success looks like:**
- Auto-updating dashboard (no Monday morning dread)
- Stakeholders can self-serve
- I get 4 hours/week back for actual analysis
- Ships in 3 weeks
