## Key Insights
- Less is more — 5 projects > 20 projects
- Dark mode felt more premium for design work
- Astro was perfect — fast builds, no JS overhead

## What I'd Do Differently
- Start with mobile layout first
- Write case study content before building

## The Journey

Full Build project: "I want to build my portfolio" → shipped in **3 sessions**.

The PRD kept scope tight. Almost added a blog — the "Out" section reminded me to ship first, add later.
