# Portfolio Website

## Problem

**What's the problem?**
I have no online presence. Recruiters can't find my work. I'm invisible.

**Who feels it?**
Me — a mid-level designer trying to land a senior role at a product company.

**How do they cope today?**
I send Figma links and PDF case studies via email. Messy, unprofessional, hard to update.

## Intention

**Mode:** Solve

**Success looks like:** 
- A live portfolio site I'm proud to share
- 3 case studies that show my process
- Contact form that works
- Ships in 2 weeks
