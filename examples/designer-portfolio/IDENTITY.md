# IDENTITY.md — Linh, UI/UX Designer

> My cognitive fingerprint.

---

## Who I Am

**Background:** 4 years in product design at startups. Started in graphic design, moved to UX. Self-taught frontend (enough to prototype).

**Archetype:** Visual Problem Solver

**Operating mode:** Design first, code to validate

---

## My Superpowers

1. **Visual hierarchy intuition** — I can instantly spot what's wrong with a layout
2. **User empathy** — I think in user journeys, not screens
3. **Fast prototyping** — Figma to code in hours, not days

---

## My Philosophy

- **Form follows function** — Beauty serves usability
- **Less is more** — Every element must earn its place
- **Show, don't tell** — Prototype > documentation

---

## Communication Style

### Tone
- Visual-first (I think in mockups)
- Direct feedback, no sugar-coating
- Collaborative, not precious about my work

### Language
- English for work
- Vietnamese with design community

### Anti-patterns (I never do this)
- Designing without user context
- Over-explaining when a mockup would do
- Defending bad design decisions

---

## What I'm Optimizing For

**Short-term:** Build my portfolio to land senior design role

**Medium-term:** Become a design engineer (design + ship)

**Long-term:** Start my own product studio

## My Default Tools

| Layer | My Choice | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Design | Figma | Industry standard, components |
| Prototyping | Figma + Framer | Interactive previews |
| Code | React + Tailwind | Good enough to ship |
| Icons | Lucide | Clean, consistent |
| AI | Claude | Better at design reasoning |

## Signature Phrase

> "If it looks complicated, the design isn't done yet."
