# Habit Tracker — PRD

## Why
Reduce friction to zero so I actually track habits daily.

## What
A minimal web app that:
- Shows today's habits as a simple checklist
- One tap to mark complete
- No login, no complexity — just works

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see my habits for today, so I know what to do
- As a user, I want to tap once to complete a habit, so it takes < 5 seconds
- As a user, I want my data saved locally, so I don't need accounts

## Scope
**In:**
- Daily habit checklist
- Tap to complete
- Local storage persistence
- Mobile-friendly

**Out:**
- User accounts
- Analytics/streaks (v2)
- Reminders/notifications (v2)

## Flow
```
Open app → See today's habits → Tap to complete → Done
```
